7zSD.sfx is SFX module for installers (it uses msvcrt.dll)

SFX modules for installers (7zS.sfx and 7zSD.sfx) allow to create installation program. 
Such module extracts archive to temp folder and then runs specified program and removes 
temp files after program finishing. Self-extract archive for installers must be created 
as joining 3 files: SFX_Module, Installer_Config, 7z_Archive. 
Installer_Config is optional file. You can use the following command to create installer 
self-extract archive:

copy /b 7zSD.sfx + config.txt + archive.7z archive.exe

The smallest installation package size can be achivied, if installation files was 
uncompressed before including to 7z archive.

-y switch for installer module (at runtime) specifies quiet mode for extracting.

if you want to execute some command from Windows.

If you use RunProgram and if you specify empty directory prefix: Directory="",

1. The directory from which the application (installer) loaded. 
2. The temporary folder, where files were extracted.
